# Workspace-Booking

### What it does?
Efficiently book workspaces for the day. Single source of truth, use CEC ID to book.

## Why workspace booking?
Avoid confusion with regards to where to sit / coordinate for lack of space on office going days.

## Where to check?
Go to http://sjc-ads-11563:3000/ 
Use your CEC id to book.
The admin panel shows all booked workspaces for the day. 

## Current Issues:

1. Not really safe - Anyone can cancel anyone else's booking, but it is meant to be a quick and dirty solution so let's keep it that way for now.
2. Some UI improvements required - Again, it is a quick fix solution, lets do that if needed in the future as a new action item.
